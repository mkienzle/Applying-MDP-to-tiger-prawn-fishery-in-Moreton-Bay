The fishery model was used to create the state transition matrices from one year to the next as a result of 11 possible fishing intensities (Fig~\ref{fig:BubblePlotOfTransitionMatrix}). When no fishing occurs, action 1, recruitment to the fishery in a given year $t+1$ is most likely to remain high irrespective to the level of recruitment in the previous year $t$. At the other hand of the spectrum of actions, when fishing effort is the largest considered, recruitment is most likely to remain small (state 1) if the previous recruitment was also small; and is more likely to become smaller (state < 5) if it was high (state 5).
