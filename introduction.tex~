Fishermen take every year decisions that have both immediate and long-term consequences for their industry: a large harvest one season might impact the capacity of the stock to regenerate for next season. Environmental factors play important roles in introducing variability in the production of marine resources, creating an uncertain environment in which fishing companies must operate. Fishing is a gamble against nature fishermen take every time they go fishing. Experience helps them distinguish between the signal and the noise but is always an element of luck involved in the process of fishing. As such, fisheries exploitation falls within a general category of problem on how to make decision in the face of uncertain outcome. The field of Optimal Decision Theory (CITE) has developed methods to deal with these problems, in particular Markov Decision Processes to deal with sequential decisions in uncertain environment.

Markov Decision Processes account for the relationship between present and future actions on the state of the resource as well as on the performance of the fishing industry (M. Puterman).  Taking into account environmental variability, MDPs is required to achieve a good performance overall.
