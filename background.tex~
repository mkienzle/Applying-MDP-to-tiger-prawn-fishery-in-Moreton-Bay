The otter-trawl fishery in Moreton Bay catches a variety of species beside tiger prawn ({\it Penaeus esculentus}). Of all those species, tiger prawn is the most valuable. Therefore, it has been the object of most research effort to understand the causes of yield variations.

The past 20 years have seen the decline of trawling effort targeting prawns in Moreton Bay \citep{Kienzle2014138}. This decline has been attributed to a range of economical factors detrimental to the industry: increased competition in the seafood market from aquaculture products have pushed prices down (REF); increasing costs of fishing, notably due to higher fuel prices (REF) and various legislations restricting fishing profitability such as prohibition to land certain by-catch species and access to specific areas previously open to fishing (REF). Economics is perceived as the main driver of the decline in trawling efforts in Moreton Bay.

On the other hand, analyses of data collected by fishermen show that tiger prawn abundance in Moreton Bay have increased over the last 20 years by a factor 2--3 \citep{Kienzle2014138}. Prawn is a short lived species \citep{garcia88c}. Mortality estimates for Moreton Bay suggests that few live for more than 1.5 years \citep{KienzleEtAl2015}. Every year, a new cohort recruit to the fishery between January and February \citep{KienzleEtAl2015} and provide the bulk of catch for that year. At the beginning of each fishing season, fishermen probe the fishing ground for the presence of tiger prawn in sufficient abundance and size to determine when they'll begin to actively target them. Similarly, at the end of the fishing season, fishermen switch to others species or areas in response to low densities resulting from stock depletion rending fishing un-economical. A single-species stock assessment was developed to account for fishing and environmental effects on the dynamics of this species. Projections with the best parameterized stock assessment showed that the levels of fishing mortality are well within the biological potential of this stock: in reference to Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), this stock is under-exploited. The most recent results indicated that abundances of tiger prawns in Moreton Bay increased in the last 20 years in response to rising sea temperature induced by climate change: it is thought that the rise of about 1 degree over the period has created a more suitable environment for this tropical species to live in Moreton Bay which is located at the extreme South of its distribution on the East coast of Australia \citep{KienzleEtAl2017}.
