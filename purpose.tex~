% What is Markov Decision Processes - how it has been uses
A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a method to determine the best course of actions to take when dealing with systems which reactions are unpredictable but quantifiable \citep{Puterman1994}. For a specific objective, an MDP provides a policy (a set of actions to be taken in specific situations) that achieves an optimal results over a period of time.

% Why did we decide to apply it to fisheries management in Moreton Bay
Fisheries management has long been recognised to fall within the class of problems that can be addressed by MDPs \citep{walters1986adaptive}. Namely, the intensity of fishing has a direct impact on the abundance of species and future states of their populations: too much fishing has been shown repetitively to lead a state of low productivity of the resource know as over-fishing \citep{hilborn2011overfishing}. On the other hand, the reaction of a stock to fishing is uncertain: stocks are often observed to produce good yields, even following large harvests, for reasons unrelated to fishing such as favourable environmental conditions. In fisheries research, survival of youngest age is largely un-predictable, induces large year to year variations of the magnitude of new recruits to the fishery and is often the largest source of uncertainty in fisheries management. The problem is exhacerbated when catches are composed almost entirely of a single year-class, which abundance depends on recruitment, as is the case with short lived species such as prawns. Therefore the tiger prawn fishery in Moreton Bay seemed a very good candidate to apply an MDP in order to understand what optimal harvest strategy this methods recommends.

%, the response of a fish stock to fishing pressure is uncertain mostly due to the very variable outcome of larval survival and recruitment
